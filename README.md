### ðŸ’™ Key Features

1. Code extraction by language:
   - The code selectively extracts code files from a GitHub repository based on the file extensions specified by the user.
   - The extracted files are saved in the "down_code" directory.

2. Merging into a single Markdown file:
   - The extracted code files are merged into a single Markdown document.
   - The content of each file is included in the Markdown document along with the file path and language type.
   - The merged Markdown document is saved in the "merged" directory with the name "repo_name.md".

3. Core code extraction:
   - The code identifies and extracts only the core code sections from the extracted files.
   - The merged Markdown document is saved in the "merged" directory with the name "core_repo_name.md".
